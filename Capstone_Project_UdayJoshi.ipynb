    "In 2016, a report was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in 2013, the average cost in the U.S. was $75,345 for a coronary artery graft surgery, whereas the costs in the Netherlands and Switzerland were $15,742 and $36,509, respectively. An estimated 22 percent of the US population has missed a consultation because they could not afford it compared an average of 11 percent between other countries including Canada, Germany, and Japan. Americans also had the lowest rate of coverage. About 10 percent of the population did not have health insurance in 2016. In the other countries studied, nearly everyone was covered.\n",

    "Heart failure (HF) is prevalent in 5.7 million people in the United States. The cost to treat HF per annum has been estimated to be between $37.2 and $39.2 billion. These figures underestimate the accurate cost of this condition. The reasons for this inaccuracy include an absence in consensus by policy makers, and missing data when HF is the primary diagnosis. There are also discrepancies in the annual pharmaceutical cost estimation for treating HFâ€”likely due to an inability by researchers to parse out drug costs for treating HF vs comorbidities.Recently a new classification scheme was developed for identifying episodes of acute decompensated heart failure, the main driver for inpatient admission for HF.\n",

    "Medicare does not negotiate prices with hospitals but uses an administrative formula that matches payments to the costs facilities should be expected to expend on beneficiaries. Hospitals, hence, do not develop pricing strategies for contracting with Medicare. However, private insurers negotiate rather than impose payments, and hospitals develop strategies with respect to negotiating prices for specific procedures and conditions. There is a minimum price below which a hospital will not contract with private insurers and a maximum price above which private insurers will not contract with a hospital, but there may exist considerable space between these pricing extremes. Therefore, it would be beneficial for hospitals to be able to predict the cost of care in order to reach a profitable rate with both private insurance companies and medicare patients. "
